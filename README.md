# Satellite Image Segmentation using U-net with Dubai Dataset

This repository contains code for a U-net based model for Satellite Image Segmentation using Dubai Dataset. The model is deployed using Hugging Face.

## Dataset

The Dubai dataset consists of high-resolution satellite images of Dubai with corresponding segmentation masks. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/semantic-segmentation-of-aerial-imagery).

## Model

The U-net architecture is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks. The model is trained on the Dubai dataset to segment building structures in satellite images. The implementation of the U-net model is in the `Satellite_Imagery_Segmentation.ipynb` file.

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed using Hugging Face. The deployed model can be accessed using the following link: [insert link to deployed model].
